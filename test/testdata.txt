## Character class

### Upper and lower case 
A proper handling of upper/lower case is well beyond the scope of
this library. Just have a look at the FAQ about case mapping/folding
(https://unicode.org/faq/casemap_charprop.html) to get how complex
would it be to deal with the general case.
I took the decision to restrict the concept of "lower/upper case" to
the characters mapped in the ASCII range (<0x80). The idea is that 
skp will most probably be used to deal with computer-related text
like programming languages, error message, ... It's not intended to 
be used as a general purpose/multi language pattern matching library.

%l matches a single ASCII lower case character
P:%l
S:abcd
0:a

S:3bce
0:

S:Abce
0:

S:àbcd
0:à


%u matches a single ASCII upper case character
P:%u
S:ABCD
0:A

P:%l
S:àbcd
0:à

P:%u
S:àbcd
0:

P:%(%+%l%)%d%(%+%l%)
S:abc3defX
0:abc3def
1:abc
2:def

### Range
